📋 Detailed Description of enhanced_cua_agent_full.py
1. What the file does (at a glance)

It is a general-purpose Computer-Using Agent (CUA) harness that can be run in three modes:

Dummy mode → simulates payload injection results (fast, no dependencies).

Playwright mode → runs real browser automation to test payloads in forms (practical MVP before full Cua integration).

CUA mode → stubbed out for now; placeholder where you integrate the real Cua SDK once you wire up containerized desktop/browser control.

It also:

Collects structured results (payload, found/not, screenshot, timestamp).

Wraps results in a TaskReport with metrics.

Optionally integrates Nuanced via CLI for call-graph/context enrichment.

Produces JSONL reports that the orchestrator can consume.

2. How it aligns with your plan steps
🔹 Step 1: Familiarization & Core Development

Plan: “Build a SOTA Computer-Use Agent using the Cua framework. Prioritize generalist improvements.”

Code: Provides a plug-in backend system. You can start in dummy or playwright mode to test your orchestrator today. When ready, swap CuaAgent stub with real Cua SDK calls to containers/computers. This ensures the same orchestrator interface works across dev → prod.

🔹 Step 2: Sub-Agent Integration

Plan: “Integrate Cua agent as sub-agent in orchestrator. Orchestrator feeds tasks + context.”

Code:

Implements SimpleOrchestrator that takes tasks (target_url, payloads, selectors).

Returns a TaskReport with structured vulnerability scan results.

Your global orchestrator agent can call enhanced_cua_agent_full.py as a subprocess or import its classes directly.

This allows easy chaining: orchestrator → CUA agent → JSON report → orchestrator aggregates.

🔹 Step 3: Nuanced Context Management

Plan: “Integrate Nuanced as MCP server to improve context management (extra 5%).”

Code:

Adds a function nuanced_enrich(file, func) → runs nuanced enrich via CLI.

Orchestrator can attach this enriched call-graph JSON into the agent’s TaskReport.

You pass --use-nuanced --nuanced-file myfile.py --nuanced-func myfunc to trigger it.

This aligns with plan by reducing hallucinations / improving code grounding.

🔹 Evaluation & Benchmarking

Plan: “Cua benchmark evaluates performance in OSWorld environment.”

Code:

Produces structured JSON lines: task_id, mode, payloads_tested, successes, runtime, evidence.

These are the exact kind of metrics that can be aggregated into the Cua benchmark pipeline.

Easy to track click accuracy, payload success, and response times.

3. Components explained for teammates
a) Agent classes

DummyAgent: fake responses (good for CI + orchestrator testing).

PlaywrightAgent: real browser automation (safe MVP).

CuaAgent: placeholder — replace with actual Cua SDK once ready.

b) SimpleOrchestrator

Wraps around any agent.

Optionally calls Nuanced to enrich context before running the agent.

Returns a TaskReport.

c) TaskReport

Structured report dataclass with:

Target URL

Payloads attempted

Number of successes

Per-payload results (screenshot, timestamp, notes)

Nuanced context (if requested)

Mode + runtime

d) Nuanced Integration

Runs nuanced enrich file function via CLI.

Captures JSON output (or raw text).

Attaches result to report.nuanced_context.

e) CLI Interface

Flags include:

--mode dummy|playwright|cua → backend

--run-demo → safe test on httpbin

--target URL → your test site (only run if you own it!)

--use-nuanced --nuanced-file file --nuanced-func func → add call-graph enrichment

--report-file path.jsonl → append structured results to file

4. How teammates can integrate this into the global orchestrator

Option A: Subprocess call

Global orchestrator spawns this file with the right flags.

Reads JSON report from stdout or report file.

Option B: Direct import

from enhanced_cua_agent_full import PlaywrightAgent, SimpleOrchestrator

Build agent object in Python, call orchestrator.run_task(...).

Receive TaskReport object directly.

5. Testing workflow for teammates

Local dry run:

python enhanced_cua_agent_full.py --mode=dummy --run-demo


Real browser run (Playwright):

pip install playwright
python -m playwright install
python enhanced_cua_agent_full.py --mode=playwright --run-demo


With Nuanced:

npm install -g @nuanced-dev/nuanced-mcp-ts
python enhanced_cua_agent_full.py --mode=playwright --run-demo --use-nuanced --nuanced-file myfile.py --nuanced-func myfunc


Integration in orchestrator:

Call this as subprocess or import it.

Capture TaskReport → convert to your orchestrator’s task schema.

6. Why this matters

Keeps dev fast → you can test orchestrator now in dummy mode.

Bridges to real automation → Playwright provides real DOM evidence before Cua SDK integration is ready.

Future-proof → Cua SDK slot ensures compliance with hackathon/judging requirements.

Improves context → Nuanced reduces LLM “forgetfulness,” aligning with benchmark’s “extra 5% boost.”

✅ In short:
This file is the plug-and-play CUA sub-agent.

Orchestrator feeds it tasks (target URL + payloads).

Agent tests and reports structured evidence.

Nuanced enriches context before/after actions.

Same interface works in simulation, Playwright, or full Cua mode.
