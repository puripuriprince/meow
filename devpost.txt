How we built it

Claude code for pentesting orchestrator with agents. Npm app built in typescript for the terminal UX. Rest is in python using langraph.
Cua agent with ctx tools and prompt evolution built in python based on alpha evolve, built in python. (ctx + evolution explanation)

subagents + Tools?
backend?
solana pay





Challenges we ran into
Getting the terminal UX to work with the local backend, the orchestrator flow, the subagents, the CUA, the false positive rate being lower than 1%.



Accomplishments that we're proud of

Breaking a bunch of webapps from founders around waterloo, SOTA on the CUA benchmark, hit rate%, prompt evolution for sota on multiple tasks.



What we learned

Solana pay, CUA, RL on openpie, Auth0,  inference on cerebras, multi-agent orchestration, warp and how to make a better agent.
